Diary Entry: March 11, 2024 - A Singaporean-Swedish Soiree

Dear Diary,

Today, our little island embraced a slice of Scandinavia. My dear friend Lars, all blue eyes and Viking spirit, arrived from Sweden. The air crackled with excitement as we embarked on a cross-cultural adventure.

Morning:

Lars marveled at the humidity, his fair skin turning a delightful shade of lobster. We strolled along the Singapore River, past colonial shophouses and modern skyscrapers.
At Merlion Park, Lars posed with the iconic half-lion, half-fish statue. “A mythical creature,” he mused. “Much like our friendship.”
Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya Toast—Lars’s first taste of kaya jam. His verdict? “Like sunshine on bread.”
Afternoon:

Sentosa Island beckoned—a playground for tourists and locals alike. Lars braved the luge, his laughter echoing through the cable car ride.
Universal Studios—a riot of colors and adrenaline. Lars, usually stoic, screamed like a banshee on the Battlestar Galactica coaster.
We shared a plate of chili crab at Jumbo Seafood. Lars wiped his mouth with a napkin, eyes watering. “Spicy, but worth it.”
Evening:

Marina Bay Sands shimmered in the twilight. Lars gasped at the rooftop pool, suspended between skyscrapers. “Swim here? Are you mad?”
Dinner at Ce La Vi—our little secret. We clinked champagne flutes, overlooking the city’s glittering spine. Lars confessed his love for durian. “An acquired taste,” he grinned.
The light show at Gardens by the Bay—supertrees dancing to music. Lars hummed along, his Swedish accent blending with the melody.
Night:

Back home, Lars sprawled on the couch. “Singapore is a symphony,” he said. “A fusion of cultures, just like us.”
We swapped stories—midsummer nights and monsoon rains. Lars promised to teach me Swedish, and I vowed to master the art of fika.
As Lars drifted to sleep, I scribbled this entry. Our worlds collided today, leaving stardust in their wake.
Skål, Lars. Till our next adventure.

Yours, Jin Wei
