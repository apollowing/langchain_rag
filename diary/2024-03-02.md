Diary Entry: March 02, 2024 - When the Sky Wept

Dear Diary,

Today, the universe conspired against me. The alarm clock waged war, dragging me from dreams too sweet to abandon. I stumbled into the office, a soldier marching to an invisible drumbeat.

Morning:

The coffee machine betrayed me—its bitter brew a metaphor for my soul. I sipped, hoping for clarity, but found only caffeine-induced jitters.
Emails piled up like unpaid debts. Requests, complaints, and cryptic messages from the IT department. I longed for a reply button that said, “I quit.”
Afternoon:

The meeting—a black hole of productivity. PowerPoint slides danced, mocking my sanity. My boss droned on, a hypnotist with a PowerPoint clicker.
Lunchtime arrived, but my sandwich tasted like cardboard. I chewed resentment, swallowed deadlines, and washed it down with lukewarm water.
Evening:

The printer jammed, ink smudging my fingers. I cursed its mechanical heart. “Why, oh why?” I whispered, as if it held answers.
Timothy called—a math problem he couldn’t solve. I pretended to be a genius, Googling equations while suppressing existential dread.
The commute home—a sardine can of misery. Sweat mingled with strangers’ sweat. The MRT doors closed, trapping us in a collective sigh.
Night:

Jamie greeted me with a smile, her eyes kind. “Bad day?” she asked. I nodded, collapsing onto the couch.
Kim, our tiny philosopher, handed me a crayon. “Draw happy,” she said. I sketched rainbows and unicorns, my heart unclenching.
As rain tapped against the window, I wrote this entry. The ink blurred—a testament to days when the sky wept alongside me.
Tomorrow, Diary, be kinder. For now, I’ll dream of sunnier skies.

Yours, Jin Wei
